Problem Statement : Online Plant Nursery

You are tasked with refactoring an online platform for a plant nursery. 
The nursery offers a variety of plants and allows customers to place orders for different types and quantities of plants. 
The system should be able to calculate the total price of an order, applying discounts for bulk purchases.

Note: Think of Clean Code Practices and start taking baby steps while refactoring

Good luck :)
